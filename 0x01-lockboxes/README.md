n number of locked boxes. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

A method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

+ Prototype: ``` def canUnlockAll(boxes)```
+ ```boxes``` is a list of lists
+ A key with the same number as a box opens that box
+ You can assume all keys will be positive integers
+ There can be keys that do not have boxes
+ The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
+ Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False

[main_0.py](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-interview/blob/main/0x01-lockboxes/test/0-main.py) is the code used to test the method.
